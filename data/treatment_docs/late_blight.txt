# Treatment Guide: Tomato Late Blight

## Disease Overview
Late Blight is a devastating disease caused by *Phytophthora infestans*, the same pathogen that caused the Irish Potato Famine. It spreads rapidly in cool, wet conditions.

## Symptoms
- Water-soaked lesions on leaves
- White fungal growth on leaf undersides
- Rapid browning and death of foliage
- Brown, greasy spots on fruit
- Disease progresses very quickly

## Immediate Treatment (URGENT)
1. **Act Immediately**: This disease can destroy entire crop in days
2. **Apply Systemic Fungicide**: Use metalaxyl or mancozeb
3. **Remove Infected Plants**: Destroy severely infected plants
4. **Spray Adjacent Fields**: Treat neighboring plants preventively

## Chemical Treatment
- Metalaxyl-based fungicide: Apply every 5-7 days
- Mancozeb: Apply at first sign of disease
- Combination products for best results

## Prevention
- Plant resistant varieties
- Avoid overhead irrigation
- Apply preventive fungicides in high-risk periods
- Monitor weather forecasts for favorable conditions

## Timeline
- Critical window: First 24-48 hours
- Spray schedule: Every 5-7 days during outbreak
- Continue for 3 weeks after last symptoms

## Cost Estimate
- Systemic fungicide: Rs 400-800 per liter
- Multiple applications needed
- Labor: Rs 800 per acre

## Expected Recovery
If caught early, 60-70% of crop can be saved. Late detection often results in total crop loss.

## ALERT
