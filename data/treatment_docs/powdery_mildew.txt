# Disease: Powdery Mildew
# Crop: Cucumber, Melon, Pumpkin, Grape

## Symptoms
- White, powdery fungal growth on the upper surface of leaves.
- Looks like the leaf has been dusted with flour.
- Leaves may turn yellow, curl, and die.

## Cultural Control
1. Sunlight: Ensure plants get full sun (6+ hours).
2. Spacing: Plant crops far enough apart to ensure good airflow.
3. Resistance: Choose resistant hybrid varieties.

## Chemical Control
- Sulfur-based fungicides are very effective if applied early.
- Potassium Bicarbonate: A organic contact fungicide.
- Neem Oil: Can help reduce mild infections.

## Immediate Treatment
1. Remove severely infected leaves to reduce spore load.
2. Spray a mixture of Baking Soda (1 tbsp) + Liquid Soap (1 tsp) + Water (1 gallon).
3. If severe, apply Wettable Sulfur immediately (do not apply if temp > 32°C).
