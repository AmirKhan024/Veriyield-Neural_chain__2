# Treatment Guide: Tomato Early Blight

## Disease Overview
Early Blight is a common fungal disease affecting tomato plants, caused by *Alternaria solani*. It typically appears as dark brown spots with concentric rings on older leaves.

## Symptoms
- Dark brown to black spots on lower leaves
- Concentric rings creating a "target" pattern
- Yellow halo around spots
- Leaves may yellow and drop
- Can spread to stems and fruit

## Immediate Treatment
1. **Remove Infected Leaves**: Immediately remove and destroy affected leaves
2. **Apply Fungicide**: Use copper-based fungicide or chlorothalonil
3. **Improve Air Circulation**: Prune plants to increase airflow
4. **Mulch**: Apply organic mulch to prevent soil splash

## Organic Solutions
- Neem oil spray (apply every 7-10 days)
- Baking soda solution (1 tablespoon per gallon of water)
- Compost tea foliar spray

## Prevention
- Water at soil level, avoid wetting leaves
- Space plants properly for air circulation
- Rotate crops yearly
- Remove plant debris promptly
- Apply mulch to prevent soil contact

## Timeline
- Treatment effectiveness: 7-14 days
- Continue monitoring for 3 weeks
- Reapply treatments weekly during humid conditions

## Cost Estimate
- Copper fungicide: Rs 150-300 per liter
- Neem oil: Rs 100-200 per liter
- Labor: Rs 500 per acre

## Expected Recovery
With proper treatment, plants should show improvement within 10 days. New growth should be healthy and disease-free.


# Disease: Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
# Crop: Tomato, Potato

## Symptoms
- Small, dark brown to black spots on older (lower) leaves.
- Spots have concentric rings (target-board effect).
- Yellowing (chlorosis) of the tissue surrounding the spots.
- Fruit may drop prematurely.

## Cultural Control (Prevention)
1. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-solanaceous crops (like corn or beans) for at least 3 years.
2. Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant debris immediately. Do not compost.
3. Airflow: Stake or cage plants to keep them off the ground and improve air circulation.
4. Irrigation: Use drip irrigation. Avoid overhead watering to keep leaves dry.

## Chemical Control (Fungicides)
- Apply Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil as a preventative spray when conditions are humid.
- If disease is established, use Azoxystrobin or Copper-based fungicides.
- Spray Interval: Every 7-10 days, or more frequently during rainy weather.

## Immediate Treatment
1. Prune all infected lower leaves immediately and burn them.
2. Apply a copper-based fungicide to protect the remaining healthy leaves.
3. Stop overhead watering; water only at the base of the plant.
