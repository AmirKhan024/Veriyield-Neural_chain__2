# Treatment Guide: Wheat Rust (Yellow/Brown/Black)

## Disease Overview
Wheat rust is caused by various fungal species. Yellow rust (stripe rust), brown rust (leaf rust), and black rust (stem rust) can significantly reduce yield.

## Symptoms
- Yellow Rust: Yellow-orange stripes parallel to leaf veins
- Brown Rust: Orange-brown pustules scattered on leaves
- Black Rust: Black pustules on stems and leaf sheaths

## Immediate Treatment
1. **Apply Fungicide**: Triazole-based fungicides are most effective
2. **Scout Fields Regularly**: Early detection is critical
3. **Monitor Weather**: Rust spreads rapidly in cool, moist conditions

## Chemical Treatment
- Propiconazole: Apply at first sign of disease
- Tebuconazole: Effective for all rust types
- Mancozeb: Can be used as preventive measure

## Application Schedule
- First spray: At disease appearance
- Second spray: 15-20 days later if needed
- Timing: Morning or evening for best results

## Prevention
- Plant resistant varieties
- Remove volunteer wheat plants
- Proper crop rotation
- Balanced fertilization (avoid excess nitrogen)

## Timeline
- Response time: 5-7 days after spray
- Second spray may be needed in 2-3 weeks
- Monitor until grain filling stage

## Cost Estimate
- Triazole fungicide: Rs 300-500 per liter
- Coverage: 200-250 ml per acre
- Labor: Rs 400 per acre

## Expected Recovery
Early treatment can prevent 40-60% yield loss. Delayed treatment reduces effectiveness significantly.

## Yield Impact
- Untreated: 30-70% yield loss
- Treated early: 5-15% yield loss
- Treated late: 20-40% yield loss
