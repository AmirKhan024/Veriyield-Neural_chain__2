# Disease: Yellow Rust / Stripe Rust (Puccinia striiformis)
# Crop: Wheat

## Symptoms
- Bright yellow or orange-yellow pustules (stripes) parallel to the leaf veins.
- Pustules can also appear on heads (glumes) of the wheat.
- In severe cases, leaves dry out and the plant looks stunted.

## Cultural Control
1. Resistant Varieties: Use resistant wheat cultivars (e.g., HD-2967, DBW-187 in India).
2. Sowing Time: Avoid very early sowing in rust-prone areas.
3. Nutrient Management: Avoid excessive Nitrogen fertilizer, as it promotes lush growth that is susceptible to rust.

## Chemical Control
- Propiconazole (Tilt): Spray @ 1ml/liter of water immediately upon seeing symptoms.
- Tebuconazole (Folicur): Effective for controlling spread.
- Triadimefon: Another systemic fungicide option.

## Immediate Treatment
1. Inspect the field. If >5% of plants show stripes, begin spraying immediately.
2. Spray Propiconazole (25 EC) at 0.1% solution.
3. Repeat spray after 15 days if the weather remains cool and humid.
